The program to match the house and user via their demographic questions works in the following way:
1. The program looks for the answers to the following questions: 
  -House Occupancy
  -Year Built
  -House Type
  -Number of Bedrooms
2. The program examines the 20 houses from the REFIT data, and checks whether the answers to the questions match the details of any house.
3. The matching of answers is weighted. Some factors are more important than others.
    -The House Occupancy of a house, if equal to the user's answer, will add 0.533 to the score of that house.
    -The number of bedrooms in a house, if equal to the user's answer, will add 0.267 to the score of that house.
    -The type of house that a house is, if equal to the user's answer, will add 0.133 to the score of that house.
    -The Year the house was Built, if equal to the user's answer, will add 0.067 to the score of that house.
    (if a house has a score of 1, it is an exact match with all the answers of the user)
4. The house with the highest score is matched with the user. If multiple houses match, the choice is random between those houses.
