The combinations are made from treating the inputs as a numeral system converting that numeral system to decimal,
then when a combination is needed, retranslating it back into the original numeral system. 
Get combinations requires:
  the input number
  how many numbers were used to create that number
  The sizes of the ranges of values that each of those numbers could be

For example:
Take the input A, B, C, D which create the input X.
A has a range of size i, B has a range of size j, C has a range of size k and D has a range of size l

A = X%i
B = ((X-A)/i)%j
C = (((((X-A)/i)%j)-B)/j)%k
D = (((((((X-A)/i)%j)-B)/j)-C)/k)%l

Through this method we can translate decimal into any numeral system of which we know the length and size of the ranges of each
column, even if each column has varying ranges.
