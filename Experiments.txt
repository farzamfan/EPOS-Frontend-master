In the experiments we want to measure two things: Power consumption and processing time.
Variables for this will be: # of inputs
                            Average duration of each input.
                            # of schedules required to be created.
                            Ranking scheme.
                            Sorting algorithms
For these experiments we want to repeat them between 50-100 times and measure the standard deviations between both Power
consumption and processing time.

We also want to measure procesing time and power consumption on the subtasks of the application. How long does the sorting 
algorithm take, the creation of schedules or the application of rank? And how much power is consumed during these subtasks?

We want between 50-100 people to use the application to gather data on their behaviour after this. Decisions need to be made
on the exact number of participating phones, and the length of the experiment. 

The actions (their names) will be fixed so that their data can be gathered under a unified heading. 

A domain with mutually exclusive subdomains needs to be chosen. This will be used in future to help balance concurrent users.
